# Taipei Travel App

This is a modern React + Tailwind CSS frontend for the Taipei Travel App.

## How to Run

### 1. Standalone Version (Immediate Preview)
Just open `index.html` or `index1.html` in any web browser. It uses CDNs for React, Tailwind, and Babel, so it works without any installation.

### 2. Development Version (For Developers)
To run the full development environment with Vite:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main entry point (Standalone version).
- `src/`: Contains the React source code.
- `vite.config.js`: Vite configuration for Tailwind v4 and React.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
